This project was my first foray into functional 3D modeling. I used [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) to create several iterations of the model and a [Printrbot](http://printrbot.com/) 3D printer to prototype each iteration. I uploaded the model to [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:139005), where the model is available for download.

For those not familiar, [Catan](http://www.catan.com/) is a board game that consists of several hexagonal cardboard tiles that are randomly arranged for each play. The tiles are held in place by a cardboard frame, which does not work well in practice. The board is difficult to assemble; tiles will often bump up at the edges, and once the board is assembled, it is very difficult to move the board without having the pieces shift all over the place. There are two primary solutions to the problem: One, purchase a large, expensive board like those offered by [Catan Boards](http://mycatanboards.com/); Two, use modular tile holders like [Hexels](http://www.thehexels.com/).

I liked the modular approach, since if you had enough of them, you can create any size board you wish to play on. Unfortunately, the production for Hexels only seems to have lasted as long as its [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1330163305/hexels-the-completely-modular-settlers-of-catan-ga). I decided instead to print out tile holders on my 3D printer. There are a few designs on Thingiverse that expanded upon Tim Walsh's idea for Hexels, but I thought I could come up with a more functional design.

Many caliper measurements, calculations, frustrations, and prototypes later, this was the result:

My design offers the following features:

* Sturdy but easy T-Style interconnection points
* Nooks for settlements, cities, and roads
* Easy removal of tiles when pressure is applied to any corner
* Minimal use of plastic

The design addresses each of the issues with the base game quite well. The resulting board is easy to assemble, the tiles stay in place, and the board is easy to move around without incurring disaster.
