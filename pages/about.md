title: About
---
I'm a [freelance software engineer](resume.html) of the Linux/OSS variety.

I have a broad range of expertise from 15 years of both [professional](resume.html) and [personal](index.html) experience.
I have a particularly strong background in embedded Linux and security practices (and the intersection of the two).
I bake in best practices regarding security, coding, and documentation into all of my professional work.
Feel free to reach out to me at [kcghost@gmail.com](mailto:kcghost@gmail.com) and we can talk about your project!

When I am *not* working I am:

* Diving into a new and exciting obscure compulsion
* Fixing something that isn't broken
	* **Addendum:** Fixing something that *is* broken, because *I broke it*
* Taking photos of my cats
* Wallowing in despair at the death of America
* Playing dem vidjeo games
	* or otherwise relishing the pop culture coup du jour...from yesterday
